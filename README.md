## Project Overview

The LMS provides a responsive and intuitive dashboard for Admin users to manage the essential components of a learning institution. Admins can:
- View statistics of registered teachers and students
- Add new teachers
- Manage user roles and permissions

Additionally, students can view their grades, subjects, and results once published by the teacher, enabling a transparent academic performance tracking system.

The system is developed using PHP for server-side logic, MySQL for database management, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Admin users can log in securely to access the admin dashboard.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can view key statistics and manage teachers and students.
- **Manage Teachers**: Admins can view, add, and edit teacher profiles.
- **View Pupils**: Admins can view and manage pupils.
- **Results Management**: Teachers can add grades for students, which students can then view in their profile once published.
- **Student Dashboard**: Students can view their grades, subjects, and results, including any recent updates to their academic records.
- **Charts and Analytics**: Pie charts show summaries for quick insights into the distribution of teachers and pupils.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for various screen sizes, enhancing user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
